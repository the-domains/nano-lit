  "All matter is spent light" - Louis Khan. At Nano-Lit Technologies, Human
  Centric Lighting is our passion. Our vision is to create products that enhance
  our environment and support healthy living. Sunlight on demand. As designers,
  we see light as a material, something that can be formed and moulded and
  cut... and that sometime soon, we will use light, the same way we use plastic,
  wood, metal or glass. We have the expertise to bring a range of novel
  technology-based products, to market on our journey to this bright future.
